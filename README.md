# pf2-pirate
Web-based implementation of Pirate King's Plunder, the Pathfinder Second Edition Beginner Box's solo adventure.

Initial code based on a tutorial by Beau Carnes.

Pathfinder by Paizo Inc., published under the ORC licence.

UPDATE: While I learned a lot from this project, trying to recreate the game in the choose-your-own-adventure format of the original was not suitable, and the code suffered from it. While I intend to tackle this project again, this iteration of it is abandoned. I will probably reuse code from it when I return to it, but it will be structured in a manner better suited for the computer interface. I will leave my incomplete code here for future reference, but this repository will likely not receive any updates in the future.
