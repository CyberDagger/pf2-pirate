    "<p>You are a wandering adventurer visiting Otari, a small town on the coast of the Starstone Isle, an enormous island magically raised out of the ocean by an ancient god. Otari is renowned for its lumber and fine wooden boats, but that's not what brought you here—you came looking for adventure!</p><p>Word has it that a vicious beast is preying upon the town's livestock, and the mayor has offered 10 gold coins to any hero who can put an end to the menace. That kind of money would pay your expenses for a month!</p><p>After asking around at a nearby tavern called the Crow's Casks, you learn that most of the attacks occur on the west side of town, not far from the shore. That seems like the best place to start your search.</p><p>You gather up your belongings and make your way out along the rocky beach to begin your hunt. It doesn't take long for you to find the entrance to a dark and mysterious cave. Large paw prints lead to and from the gloomy opening.</p>",

    "<p>The burbling sound, echoing from somewhere up ahead, grows louder with every step until you can hear the sound of rushing water clearly. As you turn a corner, the source of the sound becomes apparent. The chamber up ahead is split in half by a stream that flows through the center of the room. This swift underground river enters the room from the right and flows out to the left. Across the way, you see a passageway that continues onward, and you can just make out a staircase going down. Discarded on the ground in front of you is an old torch, probably left here by a previous explorer.</p>",

    "<p>You leap aside, avoiding the wolf’s snarling jaws and drive your sword deep into its flank. With a yowl, the wretched creature falls into the muck and goes still. You clean off your blade then wander into the cave to make sure that this wolf was the only one.</p><p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you find yourself inside a small cavern that was obviously the beast’s home. It stinks of wet fur, and there are scraps of rotting meat and bone lying about—evidence of its previous victims. Far more interesting, though, is what you spot at the back of the cave.</p><p>A crack in the far wall leads into darkness, and just above it, scratched into stone, is a symbol that looks a lot like a treasure chest. As you draw closer, you realize the crack is actually the entrance to an underground tunnel—it might just be the hiding place of some forgotten treasure.</p>",

    "<p>With a swish, your blade slices right through the snake and it falls dead at your feet with a loud thud. Stepping around its body, you check the room for anything of value. You find a very old, tarnished silver coin wedged between two stones on the floor. It must have been here for ages, but it will buy you a night at the inn back in town when this is all over.</p><p>Leaving the dead serpent behind, you head toward the passageway opposite the entrance. Unlike the caves that came before, this tunnel looks like it was carefully dug out of the earth and meticulously reinforced with wood and stone. After about 20 feet, the passageway forks, heading off to the right and the left. You can hear the faint sound of splashing water to the right, while a very cold breeze drifts out of the passage to the left. Which way do you go?</p>",

    "<p>You returned to town safely and collect your reward for killing the wolf—10 gold! But did you collect all of this adventure’s treasure? Besides the reward, you can find coins and treasure worth 40 more gold during this adventure. Remember that 10 copper is equal to 1 silver and 10 silver is equal to 1 gold. If you want to try again, you can press the buton and start over from the beginning. You might also want to go straight to building your own character for future adventures. If so, go to <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/\">Archives of Nethys</a> to begin the journey.</p>",

    "<p>The passageway winds through ancient rock, but it’s clear that someone has made it wider with a pickaxe, although it looks like the work was done many years ago. After squeezing hurriedly through a narrow crevice with a ceiling supported only by a rotting log, you find yourself in a small chamber. Roots grow down from above, breaking through the ceiling and letting in faint, dappling light here and there across the cavern. Opposite the entrance is another corridor, but before you can head down that way, you hear a terrible hissing sound coming from the passageway. Emerging from the darkness is a gigantic snake with terrifying fangs!</p><div class=\"instruction\"><p>You are now in combat with a snake! Just as when fighting the wolf, you and the snake will take turns attacking one another until one side is defeated, but there are a few new things to pay attention to in this combat.</p><p>In this fight, the snake gets to go first, but during its first turn, it must spend 2 of its 3 actions to close the distance before it can attack. So, on the snake’s first turn, it gets to spend only 1 action to attack you. On the rest of its turns it spends all 3 actions attacking.</p><p>Whenever the snake bites you, it might poison you. This happens as part of the bite, so it doesn’t use an action. When you are hit by the snake’s bite, you must attempt a Saving Throw to resist the effects of the venom. Saving throws are special rolls to resist things that try to harm or control your character. There are three kinds of saving throws: Reflex saving throws are used to dodge a bolt of lightning or a fearsome dragon’s fire breath; Will saving throws are used to resist spells that try to take over your mind; and Fortitude saving throws are used to fight off poisons and diseases.</p><p>On your turn, you can attack, just like in the previous fight. Unfortunately, there’s nothing to hide behind in this chamber, so you can’t boost your Armor Class like you could in the wolf fight.</p></div>",

    "<p>Noticing the tracks leading to the cave, you hide in the nearby underbrush, hoping to ambush whatever foul beast lives here. After just a few minutes, you hear the sounds of something approaching, and the scent of wet fur hangs heavy in the air.</p><p>Emerging from the bushes is a lean, mangy wolf carrying the body of a dead chicken in its maw. It appears to be returning home after its most recent hunt. Clearly, this is the beast that’s been preying upon the farmers’ animals. You wait until it is near then draw your shortsword and spring out to attack!</p><div class=\"instruction\"><p>You are now in combat with a wolf! You know that this feral beast cannot be tamed and must be slain to keep the farmers’ livestock safe. Both you and the wolf take turns attacking one another. You attack by rolling the 20-sided die (or d20 for short) and adding your attack bonus (which represents your skill at wielding a weapon). If the total is equal to or greater than the wolf’s Armor Class (AC for short), then the attack is a hit and deals damage. Subtract the damage from the wolf’s Hit Points (HP for short). To defeat the wolf, you must reduce the wolf to 0 HP or less. On the wolf’s turn, it will attack you—you’ll roll a d20 for the wolf, add its attack bonus, and compare the result to your AC. If the wolf reduces you to 0 HP or less, you die.</p><p>Remember that you go first. If you find that the wolf is hitting you too much, you should remember to hide with your third action to make it harder for the wolf to hit you.</p></div>",

    "<p>Your vision grows dark as life leaves your body. In your final moments, you can’t help but think that this is not how stories should end. Maybe the next hero will fare better in this deadly place...</p><p>Although you have died, there are still adventures to be had. You can start this adventure over by clicking the button. You are restored to full Hit Points, but so are all of the foes that you have faced. You must explore and face whatever dangers await you all over again. Alternatively, you can start making your own character to play in adventures with others. The full rules can be read at <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/\">Archives of Nethys</a>.</p>",

    "<p>Putting aside your fear, you squeeze your way through the crack into the narrow passageway beyond, lit only by faint light from above. If the cobwebs and dust are any indication, no one has been down this way for a long time. Up ahead, the passageway widens to form a cave chamber before veering to the left.</p><p>A curtain of moss grows on the right wall of the small cavern, fed by a trickle of water dripping from the cavern ceiling. Something about it looks odd, but you can’t quite figure it out without succeeding at a Perception check.</p><div class=\"instruction\"><p>Your Perception indicates how good you are at noticing things. To attempt a Perception check, roll a d20 and add your <strong>Perception</strong> bonus, which is a <strong>+4</strong>. Once you have rolled, compare the total to the <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC). If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, you succeed!</p></div>",

    "<p>You look around but fail to spot anything of interest. With no other way to go, you head down the corridor that leads off to the left. You notice a faint breeze as you make your way down that tunnel.</p>"
